# Haptic Noise

Code used in the Haptic Noise project, led by Jenna FRADIN and Chloe DESCHANET,
aiming to explore the effect of noisy textures on human perception.

## Generate textures -> gen_texture

## Simple background removal -> bg_remove.py

See [INCONGRUENCY_HARDWARE.md](docs/INCONGRUENCY_HARDWARE.md) for instructions on building the setup.

## Visuohaptic experiment -> main.py
